Animated Background Header
=========
In this repo I will show you how I used some inspiration from [(https://tympanus.net)] to create a back-ground animation for my website. Full working implementation here [(https://albyati.com)]

This animation has its own JavaScript and also uses tweens from the GreenSock GSAP animation library.
The original source code can be found in the article link below.
